                    <li>Robert hears of a new local policy their county is trying to implement via an ad on tv. It sounds like it would be 
                        terrible for businesses but everything online he can find about it seems to be split 50/50. His client asks him about 
                        it, but Robert isn't sure what the policy does. On his lunchbreak he decides he is going to use his phone see what 
                        his local chamber of commerce has for resources to learn more about it.

                        Robert looks up when the next meeting for their local chamber of commerce is and sees if the other business owners are 
                        going to be attending so that he could help his client meet with them and discuss possible solutions to their problem.
