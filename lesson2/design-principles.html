    <div id="one" class="principle">
        <h2>Repitition</h2>
        <span>D&D Beyond</span>
        <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">https://www.dndbeyond.com/</a>
        <img src="./images/dnd-beyond_snip.jpg" alt="dndbeyond.com">
        <p>
        This use to be the design for all people who visited the site, it recently has changed 
        to be for only logged in users, however the 4 main items to interact with present in the 
        screenshot are first shown at the top of the page, a feed, then once against at the bottom. 
        The feed itself uses a square grid with the bottom half of the squares being the title 
        and the top half being a thumbnail.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="two" class="principle">
        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <span>Plex</span>
        <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">https://www.plex.tv/</a>
        <img src="./images/plex_snip.jpg" alt="Plex.tv">
        <p>
            This site uses contrast well as the white text against gradient background helps it to 
            stand out, followed by the orange button against the blue-ish hue behind it, which is then 
            proceeded by the various shows and movies thumbnails skewed in the background 
            right below it, creating alot of contrast between the background's top and bottom half 
            as well as the text and button above it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="three" class="principle">
        <h2>Proximity</h2>
        <span>Steam</span>
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">https://store.steampowered.com/</a>
        <img src="./images/steam-store_snip.jpg" alt="Steam Store">
        <p>
            The Steam store webpage packs alot together in a small place and keeps like minded things 
            together very well while still being very presentable. This is evident by their header
            present in the lower part of the screenshot, which is one of many on their page used to 
            organize its content into isolated places allowing users to scroll and select what they 
            want quickly and effectively. <br>
            They also keep their various webpage categories towards the top as well as a button 
            for more options in the top left leading to a very compact and effective presentation.
